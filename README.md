# Challenge-Week-1-Accessibility

## Description

What was your motivation?
- My motive was to make the website more accessible to everyone.

Why did you build this project?
- I helped refactor the code to make it more accessible to anyone using the file. I also helped make it easier for someone who needs help with the accessibility while visting the site. 

What problem does it solve?
- It solves the issue with the 'alt' tags and makes it easier for someone using a screen reader. 
- Condensed the code in the HTML and arranged the CSS file so that it follows same structure as the HTML.
- Replaced the Div tags with more descriptive elements.
- Combined the repetitive classes tags in the CSS file under their own group. It will help keep the file more organized and easier to read.
